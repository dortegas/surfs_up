# Surfs Up

## Overview
The project focus is the analysis of temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii. Specifically, statistics of temperature data were requested for June and December because Avy wanted more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
